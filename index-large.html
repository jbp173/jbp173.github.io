				<h1>About this Project</h1>

				<h2>
				<p>
				For this assignment, I kinda just turned on the magnifier and tried just doing what I normally would for a few hours. I browsed Reddit, then attempted to watch YouTube while playing Hearthstone. Throughout that I switched over to Facebook and IM'ed every so often.  
				</p>
				<p>
				The hardest part for me was getting used to the controls, it took me a minute to realize that the panning that happens only gets you as far as your normal screen and doesn't quite work like the middle mouse button, you still have to scroll like normal. 
				</p>  
				<p>
				Using Reddit wasn't aweful, and I got used to it after a few minutes. Switching back to Facebook ended up being a bit annoying though, since I wasn't using Messenger and so I had to find the Facebook tab then find my message window. I had Facebook set to the first tab, which was easy to pan too by moving my mouse to the corner, and I discovered that, since the message windows pop up in the bottom right corner I could also just set my mouse to the bottom right to pan over quickly.
				</p>
				<p>
				Watching YouTube was much more difficult, since the video took up most of the screen, and the panning ended up being too sensitive when I would try to correct it. It even took me a while to realize I had part of the video cut off at the top. Things got weird when I switched to also playing Hearthstone. I wasn't able to see the full window all the time, so I would have to be constantly panning to see the full thing. I ended up getting it to a spot where I could see most of the video on the right side of my sceen and enough of the Hearthstone window too see generally when I needed to focus and react. With Hearthstone being a game you don't really need to constantly attend to, it ended up working pretty okay, and I don't think it had any impact on how I played, besides a minor slowdown. I ended up just playing for an hour and a half like that. 
				</p>
				<p>
				As far as things I added, I just changed the website to have high contrast and increased the font size to 200% as was asked, and it ended up working almost perfectly with what I had set up already.
