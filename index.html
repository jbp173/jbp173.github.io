			<h1> Chilli, the Best Flamingo </h1>

			<p> General Intro Text here </p>

				<h2> About Chilli </h2>

				<p> Chilli is Australia's only flamingo. He is 74, and has lived in Australia since the late 1970's. He has arthritis, which is sad.  </p>

				<p> <img src = "chili.jpg" alt = "An orange flamingo" width = "320" height = "240" </p>

				<p> Chilli will probably be the last flamingo in Australia, since biosecurity issues prohibit the zoo from importing any more. </p>

				<h2> Jordan, why is that Flamingo orange!? </h2>

				<p> I'm glad you asked. You see, flamingos get their color from their diet, so since they eat shrimp, that turns them pink. Chilli's zoo has trouble sourcing shrimp, so they feed him a carrot based broth. </p>
