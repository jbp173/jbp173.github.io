			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Instructions for using the app: <p> There are two sample interfaces in my app, a two button and a three button. The two button's controls are: Z- next, X- select. The three button's controls are: A- previous, S- next, D- select.</li>

				<li>Test procedure: <p>The conditions I tested were between my two and three button interfaces. I tested 3 times with 5 equations. The problems were: 
				<ol>
					<li>
						97*42= 4074
					</li>
					<li>
						2+2+2+2+2= 10
					</li>
					<li>
						6/2= 3
					</li>
					<li>
						321+123= 444
					</li>
					<li>
						498+3287-3905*2= -240
					</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				</li>
				<li>Test Results: <p>
				<ul>
					<li>Two Buttons</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Trial 1: 2m 11s. Errors: 7</li>
						<li>Trial 2: 1m 40s. Errors: 2</li>
						<li>Trail 3: 1m 33s. Errors: 3</li>
					</ol>
					<li>Three Buttons</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Trial 1: 1m 7s. Errors: 5</li>
						<li>Trial 2: 1m 17s. Errors: 10</li>
						<li>Trail 3: 0m 56s. Errors: 2</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Results: <p>
				Two Button Average: 1m 49.3s. Errors: 4<br>
				Three Button Average: 1m 6.67s. Errors: 5.67<p>
				The two button trial was on average 40 seconds slower than with three buttons, but had a smaller error rate. Errors were typically going too far and missing the needed number. This was a larger issue in the two button trial, which can be seen from the error rate. Even though there were less errors on average, the trails ended up being much longer due to going too far, since 15 key presses were required to correct it. Other errors included pressing the wrong keys, which was most common in the three button trial. The two button trail also caused fatiuge more quickly than in the three button trial.
